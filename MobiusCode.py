###  Code Structuring
"""

 Crating MobiusStrip Class with methods generating points,
 computing surface area, calculating edge length, and visualizing the strip.
 After that writing main function. In main function we read inputs to perform custom inputs
"""

### Surface Area Approximation
""" => As we know that Mobius strip is a continuous curved surface,
        we approximate its area by dividing it into tiny triangular segments.
    => Re-calling the concept of vector cross-products in Vector calculus,
        we find area of each triangle and sum them up to get surface area.
    =>Libraries helped us alot in methods
"""

#### Challenges
"""
    => directly we are unable to run this in vscode for this we need to install libraries
    =>The surface isnâ€™t flat, so breaking it into triangles generates errors.
    =>While calculating Edge,Identifying the correct edge points without
           redundancy was difficult.
    =>It took much time for identifying errors and debugging
